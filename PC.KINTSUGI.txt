Tips from video artist Autr, on upcycling bt848/878 cards:

=== Multiplexing & Simultaneous Inputs ===

It's easy to get confused about the number of simultaneous inputs on bttv cards. Each bt848/878 chip has 4 CVBS inputs, but they are multiplexed, and only one can be viewed at a time - so a single chip card may have 4 physical CVBS inputs, and a 4 chip card may have 16 physical CVBS inputs. When picking a card, you can simply count the number of Conexant bt848/878 chips on it to find the number of simultaneous inputs - which are quite large and hard to miss. 

If the card has more than 2 chips on it, often there will be a DIN or serial-type socket for use with a break-out cable (which of course doesn't exist anymore). So some trial and error can be done to find the pin numbering: use a multimeter to find each ground pin, and then prod the rest with the tip of your CVBS cable. 

When loading the driver, you must repeat the card number for each chip if you would like simultaneous inputs. For example the Geovision 800A has 4 x Conexant chips on it, so load it like so:

 sudo modprobe bttv card=157,157,157,157 vbibufs=32 gbuffers=32


Notice that the buffer size is also increased, which is helpful if you intend to capture all
